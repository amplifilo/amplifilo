ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there 
Iâ€™m Petro Maksymovych (@amplifilo)

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computational thinking of any sorts and flavors,
and by day I practice scanning tunneling and force microscopy which looks
at matter on atomic scale. 

ðŸŒ± I spend a fair amount of time on breaking through the barriers of 
data analysis and interpretation, from basic reporting, to visualizaiton,
to ML and physics modeling.

I'd be glad to get your feedback on my repos. I practice Python and Wolfram
Language interchangeably.
